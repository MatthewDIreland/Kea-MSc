This repository contains the most important files from my thesis, which was on the analysis of trail camera monitoring footage taken inside and outside kea (_Nestor notabilis_) burrows. 

I had a large dataset of around 1.5 million trail camera images and developed an approach which groups photos into sessions of animal activity, from each of which one photo is selected for tagging. This reduced the number of photos needing tagging in my dataset by over 97%, while missing only an estimated 3% of the sessions of predators in the data. For more detail regarding this, see my thesis at: tbd.

This repository also contains other files of interest - photos found of predators entering kea burrows and predating kea eggs, as well as various other files associated with my approach that may be of interest to those analysing similar data.
