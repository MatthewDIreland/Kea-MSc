This repository contains the most important files for the approach used in my thesis which minimises the number of photos needing manual tagging in a large trail camera dataset. 
In my case I had a large dataset of around 1.5 million trail camera images taken inside and outside kea (_Nestor notabilis_) burrows. It reduced the number of photos needing manual tagging by grouping photos into sessions of animal activity, from each of which one photo is selected for tagging. 
In my dataset, this reduced the number of photos needing tagging by over 97%, while missing only an estimated 3% of the sessions of predators in the data. For more detail regarding this, see my thesis at:
here

This repository also contains other files of interest - photos found of predators entering kea burrows and predating kea eggs, as well as various other files associated with the approach I took that may be of interest to those analysing similar data.
