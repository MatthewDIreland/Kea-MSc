This repository contains the most important files from my thesis, which focussed on the analysis of trail camera monitoring footage taken inside and outside kea (_Nestor notabilis_) burrows. 

I had a large dataset of around 1.5 million trail camera images and developed an approach which groups photos into sessions of animal activity, from each of which one photo is selected for tagging. This reduced the number of photos needing tagging in my dataset by over 97%, while missing only an estimated 3% of the sessions of predators in the data. For more detail regarding this, see my thesis at: tbd.

The repository is split into two sections: one containing files relevant to my session approach that may be of interest to those analysing similar data, and the other containing results and miscellaneous files supplementary to my thesis.

Other material (full captive footage or trail camera footage) which could not be uploaded here may be available upon request (matthewdavidireland@gmail.com).
